# this is webpack crash course from traversy media

# npm run script-key


# npm i uuid --- ( adding uuid number for me )
# then
# import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid'
# then
# output uuidv4
# but not recommended cause its more complicated

# you can remove "--mode production" inside package.json in scripts after creating
# webpack.config.js with 
# module.exports = {
#    mode: 'development',
# }
# #inside of it
